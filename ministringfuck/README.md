# Why this interpreter ?

When I was a student I did a small project to convert a Brainfuck program to C
I really liked it, it was funny to run some programs like that
Then this days I was browsing codewars and I found some exercises about the exolangs interpreters. It reminded me of my project and I wanted to try to handle some more

# Why Go ?

I discovered Go a while back, but I never tried to do something with it
Since it's really close to C in some concept, after doing a lot of Python and Javascript I decided to try this one for real
I wanted to use a struct with a pointer to function like I did in C so I thought it would be handy to do it with Go

# How does it work ?

You just have to call the function like in did in the `main` func
